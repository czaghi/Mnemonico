About:

	Mnemônico is a tool that simulates message exchanges between processes. 
	Such exchanges could happen between processes with blocking or non-blocking sends and receives.
	We also enable the option in which these operations are buffered or unbuffered.
	

Configuration:

	To run the program, it suffices to have Java installed in the computer. Nothing more is needed.
	Install the most recently updated version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK):
	Link to JRE:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnpt
Choose the option that suits your system.

Installation:

	There is no installation to Mnemônico. It is enough to run the .jar file.
	If you have the version with music, the music file must be on the same directory as the .jar.

Execution:
	
	1 - Choose a language for the simulation.
